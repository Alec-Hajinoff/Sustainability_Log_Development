Welcome to Climate Bind docs contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

# New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the README.md file. Please email us at team@climatebind.com for a list of features that we are working on.

# Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs you can open a new issue.

# Solve an issue

As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

# Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.

- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - Getting started with GitHub Desktop (https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting     up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to fork the repo!

- Using the command line:
  - Fork the repo (https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original     project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

# Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to use the Self review checklist (https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/self-review-checklist) to speed up the review process.

# Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.

- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged.

- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this  git tutorial (https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

# Your PR is merged!

Our team thanks you!
