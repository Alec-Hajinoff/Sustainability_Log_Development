        Sustainability Log is a web application that helps small ethical
        companies create a self verifiable, timestamped, and easily shareable
        digital record of their sustainability journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        The aim is not to rate companies but to empower them to build trust
        through transparency, focusing on the timeline of progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        The application allows a company to enter data that is related to its
        sustainability efforts, the application logs this data to the blockchain
        by emitting events and provides a publicly accessible timeline of
        sustainability logs over time, demonstrating the company's efforts on
        the sustainability journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        The value is the ability for the company to demonstrate in a verifiable
        way its sustainability journey to its customers, suppliers, investors.
