Sustainability Log is a web application that helps small ethical companies create a self verifiable, timestamped, and easily shareable digital record of their sustainability journey.

The aim is not to rate companies but to empower them to build trust through transparency, focusing on the timeline of progress.

The application is built with React (frontend), PHP (backend), MySQL (database), Solidity smart contract (blockchain).

It allows a company to enter data that is related to its sustainability efforts, the application logs this data to the blockchain by emitting events and provides a publicly accessible timeline of sustainability logs over time, demonstrating the company's efforts on the sustainability journey.

The value is the ability for the company to demonstrate in a verifiable way its sustainability journey to its customers, suppliers, investors.
